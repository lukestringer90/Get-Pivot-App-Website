## What is Pivot?

Pivot gives you an easy and powerful way of building pivot tables on your iPhone and iPad.

Pivot tables are a [data processing technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) that let you pick out important information from a set of data. 

For example, you might want to see how much you spend across different spending categories in your bank statement, and order these from highest to lowest. Or given a spreadsheet of event attendees, work out how many people have specific kinds of dietary needs. 

Pivot implements all the key features offered by Microsoft Excel for building pivot tables, but has none of the complexity. Visualising your pivot tables is easy with the beautiful, full colour charts, and you can export your data in professional reports to share with others.

Pivot is aimed at Excel users already familiar with pivot tables who are looking to perform data analysis on their iOS device. However, Pivot is designed with a simple and intuitive user interface so anyone can pick it up and start building pivot tables easily.

## About the Developer

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Luke Stringer](https://stringer.dev), the developer of Pivot. 

I've been building iOS apps since iPhone OS 3. As an engineering manager I use Excel to analyse output and efficiency metrics for my team, and pivot tables are the perfect tool for this. I couldn't find an app that implemented pivot tables on iOS (including the official Microsoft Excel iOS app), so I thought I'd build one myself!
